# Supabase Quickstart - SvelteKit - Todo App

Following: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-sveltekit

It instructs us to use app.supabase.com, but we should be able to develop locally as well
if we do `supabase db remote commit`. We also need to setup the `config.toml` with the
settings manually.

> question: are all features supported?
> * Edge functions only supports a single function
> * Is federated auth supported? Magic link auth?
> * Storage?
> It would be better if there was no difference between dev/prod servers
